This repository contains a simple program that utilizes hexagonal architecture, with the original source code provided by Alistair Cockburn in **Hexagonal** forlder.

The **HexagonalSplitted** folder includes the same code as the **Hexagonal** folder but is organized into multiple classes.
Additionally, it implements two adapters: one that returns a constant tax rate and another that retrieves the tax rate from a local file named taxrate.txt.
