This repository contains a simple program that utilizes hexagonal architecture,
with the original source code provided by
[Alistair Cockburn](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn)
in [Hexagonal](Hexagonal) folder.

The [HexagonalSplitted](HexagonalSplitted) folder includes the same code as the
[Hexagonal](Hexagonal) folder but is organized into multiple classes.
Additionally, it implements two adapters: one that returns a constant tax rate and
another that retrieves the tax rate from a local file named taxrate.txt.
